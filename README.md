# svelte-gameoflife

A port of https://github.com/charlee/react-gameoflife to Svelte, just for fun and learning at [NantesJS](https://nantesjs.org/)! Written with https://twitter.com/Lythom, https://twitter.com/AlexVilain, and Tarek.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
